                <p> This paper improves the time dependence on L<sub>max</sub> in solving the problem of estimating effective resistance (ER) on undirected graphs. Here,  L<sub>max</sub> is a graph parameter influenced by the mixing time of random walks on the graph. We emphasize that the value of L<sub>max</sub> in real-world networks can be very large. However, previous work often simply assumes a small value for L<sub>max</sub>, which can result in significant approximation errors. We hope this paper draws attention to the critical role of  L<sub>max</sub> in ER approximation.

                  <p>We establish matching upper and lower bounds for the worst-case computational complexity of single-node PageRank computation on directed graphs. Additionally, for the celebrated ApproxContributions algorithm (also known as Backward Push or Local Push, proposed by Andersen, Borgs, Chayes, Hopcroft, Mirrokni, and Teng in WAW 2007), we upper bound its worst-case computational complexity on directed graphs and prove its optimality by establishing a matching lower bound. </p>
